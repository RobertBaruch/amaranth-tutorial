# Values

> Note: This chapter is merely a short introduction. The [Values](https://amaranth-lang.org/docs/amaranth/latest/lang.html#values), [Constants](https://amaranth-lang.org/docs/amaranth/latest/lang.html#constants), [Shapes](https://amaranth-lang.org/docs/amaranth/latest/lang.html#shapes), and [Signals](https://amaranth-lang.org/docs/amaranth/latest/lang.html#signals) chapters of the Amaranth language guide go into more detail.

A `Value` is a basic type, but you generally don't use `Value` directly. Instead, you use subtypes such as `Const` or `Signal`. You'll mainly use `Signal`, but let's look at `Const` first to get an idea of the way to specify constants. Then `Signal` will make more sense.

## Const

A `Const` is a literal value, with a given number of bits, that does not change.

## Shapes: widths and signedness

How does Amaranth know how many bits the value has? If you simply construct a `Const` out of an integer, like `a = Const(10)` then you'll get exactly as many bits as needed to fit the integer. In this example, four bits. However, you can specify the number of bits you want by adding its width and signedness (its *shape*): `a = Const(10, unsigned(16))` will give you a 16-bit unsigned value.

You can specify that the value is signed, which affects things like magnitude comparisons. `a = Const(-10)` will automatically create a signed value. But `a = Const(10, signed(16))` explicitly creates a 16-bit signed value.

Note that signed values are 2's complement values. `Const(-10)` creates a *5-bit signed value*, because the minimum representation of `-10` in 2's complement is `10110`.

You can retrieve the shape and signedness of a `Value`, and also show a string representation:

```python
>>> from amaranth import *
>>> a = Const(10)
>>> a.shape()
unsigned(4)
>>> a.width
4
>>> a.signed
False
>>> a.shape().width
4
>>> a.shape().signed
False
>>> a
(const 4'd10)
```

```python
>>> from amaranth import *
>>> a = Const(-10)
>>> a.shape()
signed(5)
>>> a.width
5
>>> a.signed
True
>>> a
(const 5'sd-10)
```

Conveniently, `len()` will retrieve the size of the value:

```python
>>> from amaranth import *
>>> a = Const(-10)
>>> len(a)
5
```

In general, a `Const` can be created using `Const(<value>, <shape>)`. We have already seen the shapes for `signed(n)` and `unsigned(n)`.

## Shapes: ranges

Just like `Const(10, unsigned(16))` creates a constant of 10 whose size is large enough to hold any 16-bit unsigned integer, `Const(10, range(51))` creates a constant of 10 whose size is large enough to hold any integer between 0 and 50 inclusive, which in Python is `range(51)`.

If the range contains a negative number, then the constant will be signed: `Const(3, range(-5, 11))` is of a size to hold any value between -5 and +10 inclusive, which makes it a 2's complement 5-bit signal:

```python
>>> from amaranth import *
>>> x = Const(3, range(-5, 11))
>>> x.shape()
signed(5)
```

### Shapes: enums

Given a Python enum with all integer values, you can create a constant out of it:

```python
from enum import Enum, unique

@unique
class Func(Enum):
    NONE = 0
    ADD = 1
    SUB = 2
    MUL = 3
    DIV = 4

...

>>> x = Const(2, Func)
>>> x.shape()
unsigned(3)
>>> x
(const 3'd2)
```

This is the equivalent of finding the minimum and maximum value of the enum, and then using that as the range for the constant. In the example above, it would be the same as `Const(2, range(0, 5))`.

You can also use this syntax, which might be better since you can use the enumerated value instead of the integer:

```python
>>> x = Value.cast(Func.SUB)
>>> x.shape()
unsigned(3)
>>> x
(const 3'd2)
```

The enumerated values of the enum can be used anywhere a `Const` can be used, so that `Func.SUB` is equivalent to `Const(2, range(0, 5))` or `Const(2, Func)` or `Value.cast(Func.SUB)`.

## Signals

A `Signal` is a value that does change. Signals may be implemented as flipflops or wires. The backend will figure it out based on how they are used. It's the equivalent of `wire`, `reg`, or `logic` in Verilog.

Just like a `Const`, a `Signal` has a shape: a width and a signedness. You can create a 16-bit unsigned `Signal`, for example, by `a = Signal(16)` or `a = Signal(unsigned(16))`. You can specify a signed 16-bit `Signal` via `a = Signal(signed(16))` -- this will represent values from -0x8000 through +0x7FFF.

If you don't specify a shape at all: `a = Signal()`, the shape of such a `Signal` is one bit, unsigned.

Again, like with `Const`, you can retrieve the shape of a `Signal`:

```python
>>> from amaranth import *
>>> a = Signal(signed(4))
>>> a.shape()
signed(4)
```

Again, note that `signed(4)` gives you a 4-bit 2's complement signal which can represent anything from -8 to +7. If you meant to create a Signal that is 4 bits *plus a sign* in order to represent -16 to +15, then of course you will want `signed(5)`.

### Signal from range

`Signal(range(11))` creates an unsigned signal large enough to hold any integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, which in Python is `range(11)`. As with `Const`, if the range contains a negative number, the resulting signal will be signed:

```python
>>> from amaranth import *
>>> x = Signal(range(-5, 11))
>>> x.shape()
signed(5)
```

### Signal from enum

Given a Python enum as above, you can create a signal for holding such values:

```python
from enum import Enum, unique

@unique
class Func(Enum):
    NONE = 0
    ADD = 1
    SUB = 2
    MUL = 3
    DIV = 4

...

>>> x = Signal(Func)
>>> x.shape()
unsigned(3)
```

Again, as with `Const`, this is the equivalent of finding the minimum and maximum value of the enum, and then using that as the range for the signal. In the example above, it would be the same as `Signal(range(0, 5))`.

### Signal names

The name of a signal is by default the name of the variable you assign it to:

```python
>>> from amaranth import *
>>> x = Signal(unsigned(16))
>>> x.name
'x'
```

The name can be explicitly specified via the `name` named argument in its constructor.

```python
>>> from amaranth import *
>>> x = Signal(unsigned(16), name="addr")
>>> x.name
'addr'
```

At elaborate time, if the name collides with an existing name, a new name will be chosen using prefixes and suffixes.
