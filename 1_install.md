# Install

## Install all the things

YosysHQ has put together a [comprehensive installer](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build#installation) containing everything you need, and then some. Simply follow the instructions.

### Tip for Windows users

If you just downloaded the exe file, it will be in your Downloads folder. Run the executable, and it extracts everything to Downloads/oss-cad-suite. You can simply move the oss-cad-suite directory to somewhere more convient.

*Do not use PowerShell*. Use Command Prompt instead. Always be sure to run `<your-directory>\oss-cad-suite\environment.bat` in Command Prompt before doing any work. You'll know if the environment was set properly if you see `[OSS CAD Suite]` before your prompt:

```txt
F:\amaranth-exercises>..\oss-cad-suite\environment.bat

[OSS CAD Suite] F:\amaranth-exercises>
```
